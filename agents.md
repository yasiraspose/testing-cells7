## Agent Responsibilities

The Aspose.Cells Product Agent performs the following tasks:

3. Builds and validates generated code examples
4. Applies automated fixes using an LLM when needed
5. Publishes validated examples to the appropriate category folders
6. Creates pull requests for owner review

Only examples that successfully **build and run** are published.

Each category contains:

- C# example files
- `agents.md` listing the tasks implemented in that category

Example categories include:

- Conversion
